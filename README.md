### I. Description
Grootiful is a markup up of a client-facing retail portal. The application is made up of four widgets which work together to provide information about the product in such a way the customer will want to purchase the product(s).  The four main widgets are Overview, Related Products, Questions & Answers, and Ratings & Reviews. The Overview widget allows a customer to get general information about a product and add the product to their cart for purchase. Related Products displays other items similar to the selected product to entice the customer to bundle their purchase. The Questions & Answers widget allows the customer to query questions, view or add answers, and ask questions of their own. Lastly, Ratings & Reviews displays a filterable list of other customer's feedback, breaks down the products characteristics, and allows customers to add reviews of their own.
